## 📍 Overview

***Objective***

The objective of this CLI tool is to provide developers with a streamlined starting point for web development projects, offering a basic structure that includes essential components such as login and signup pages, along with a rudimentary routing system. By incorporating Tailwind CSS and SCSS, developers can leverage the power of utility-first CSS and enhanced styling capabilities to customize the appearance of their applications efficiently.

Tailwind CSS allows developers to rapidly prototype user interfaces by composing styles from a comprehensive utility class library, while SCSS provides the flexibility to define custom styles and organize CSS code more effectively. This combination empowers developers to create visually appealing and responsive web applications without the overhead of setting up these foundational components from scratch.

With a minimalistic setup and pre-configured integration of Tailwind CSS and SCSS, developers can quickly bootstrap their projects and focus on building out the core features of their applications, accelerating the development process and improving productivity.

***Motivation***

Streamlines documentation creation and maintenance, enhancing developer productivity. This project aims to enable all skill levels, across all domains, to better understand, use, and contribute to open-source software.<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> <sub>This CLI tool serves as a basic starter file for jumpstarting your projects. It provides a minimalistic setup to help you get started quickly with your development.</sub>
